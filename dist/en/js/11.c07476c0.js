Our back-end engineers don't even need to know the front-end knowledge. We can build a complete back-end management system in half an hour.\nIf your requirements are not complicated, just simple crud, then all you need are serveral golang files, the structure like this:\n\n```shell\n.\n└── management_platform\n    ├── main.go         entrance\n    ├── users.go        business table\n    ├── products.go     business table\n    ├── ...\n    └── orders.go       business table\n```\n\nYou can run it. All files can be packaged into a single binary file, which is very convenient for distribution and deployment."}}]);
